# 🎬 MovieLens Recommendation System

This project explores the **MovieLens 1M dataset** and demonstrates how a **recommendation system** can be built using user ratings. It includes data exploration, visualization, and insights on movie preferences across different demographics.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This notebook extends initial **data exploration** and introduces methods for **personalized movie recommendations** using user ratings. The main objectives include:

✅ **Aggregating movie ratings by men aged 25+ for each genre**  
✅ **Identifying the top 5 most-rated movies**  
✅ **Comparing average ratings between different age groups**  
✅ **Analyzing movies from a specific year and how different age groups rated them**  
✅ **Building a function to find movies rated similarly by the same user**  
✅ **Exploring additional trends and insights from the dataset**  

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of **1 million movie ratings** from **6,000 users** on **4,000 movies**. It is structured into three tables:  
- **Ratings**: User ratings for movies  
- **Users**: Demographic details (age, gender, occupation)  
- **Movies**: Titles, release years, and genres
